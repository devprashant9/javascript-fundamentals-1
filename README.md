# javascript-fundamentals-1
After completeing HTML and CSS I begun to learn Javascript but obviously with my own codng style as far as possible. So the codes written here may be different from that being shown in the video. This is the first part of the video in which you will learn basics of Javascript which enables you to become an efficient programmer. You can get Notes and Slides from youtube description. I have also written nodes inside the codes which will help you to understand the code better.

The tutorial I have followed is from "Apna College". Below is the link of the complete video. It's a one shot video but I have broken it into 2 parts. This is the first part and the second part will be uploaded later once I complete the entire video. Codes may vary completely from the video.

In the video file are being run in browsers conole but I have used node js to run codes in the terminal. You can choose any of them. I recommende you to choose browser.

  -1.) To run file using node js, simply go to 
    [https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current]
  -2.) Download it and install it like any other normal application
  -3.) Cross check installation by opening cmd and type --version. It must show the version of node js installed
  -4.) To run file using node js use node and then file name. Eg: [node index.js]
